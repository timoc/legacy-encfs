/*
   Implements Encfs V1.x ciphers support.

   Design:
   Variable algorithm, key size, and block size.

   Partial blocks, keys, and names are encrypted using the cipher in a pseudo
   stream mode (CFB).

   Keys are encrypted with 2-4 (KEY_CHECKSUM_BYTES define) checksum bytes
   derived from an HMAC over both they key data and the initial value vector
   associated with the key.  This allows a good chance at detecting an
   incorrect password when we try and decrypt the master key.

   File names are encrypted in the same way, with 2 checksum bytes derived
   from an HMAC over the filename.  This is done not to allow checking the
   results, but to make the output much more random.  Changing one letter in a
   filename should result in a completely different encrypted filename, to
   help frustrate any attempt to guess information about files from their
   encrypted names.

   Stream encryption involves two encryption passes over the data, implemented
   as:
   1. shuffle
   2. encrypt
   3. reverse
   4. shuffle
   5. encrypt
   The reason for the shuffle and reverse steps (and the second encrypt pass)
   is to try and propogate any changed bits to a larger set.  If only a single
   pass was made with the stream cipher in CFB mode, then a change to one byte
   may only affect one byte of output, allowing some XOR attacks.

   The shuffle/encrypt is used as above in filename encryption as well,
   although it is not necessary as they have checksum bytes which augment the
   initial value vector to randomize the output.  But it makes the code
   simpler to reuse the encryption algorithm as is.
